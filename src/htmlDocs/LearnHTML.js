            HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It forms the structure and content of web pages by using a markup system comprised of various elements and tags. HTML elements are the building blocks that define the different parts of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and more.
            
            HTML utilizes a hierarchical structure where elements are nested within each other, creating a document object model (DOM) that browsers interpret to display web content. It's not responsible for styling or layout; rather, it focuses on organizing and presenting content.

            The language consists of tags enclosed in angle brackets, like &lt;tagname&gt;, which denote elements. Tags are often paired, creating an opening tag &lt;tagname&gt; and a closing tag &lt;/tagname&gt;, encapsulating content between them. Attributes can also be included within tags to provide additional information about an element.

            HTML is complemented by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. CSS is used for styling and layout, while JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages. Together, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the core technologies for building and designing websites and web applications.
